  <h1><code>templateEngineOverride</code> Breaks Permalink Shortcode</h1>
  <div>2023/04</div>

  <p>
    When a page uses <code>templateEngineOverride</code>, it forgets how to
    process shortcodes used in the <code>permalink</code> Front Matter value,
    but only on the second and subsequent builds of the page.

  <h2>Example</h2>
  <p>
    My site is a blog and I use a shortcode which formats the post dates so that
    they work as part of the URL.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    I want to write a post discussing Liquid
    syntax and I don't want the Liquid code used in the post to be processed by
    the template engine. So, I change the template engine so that the Liquid
    code in the post isn't processed.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this situation, if I use the command <code>npx @11ty/eleventy</code>,
    there are no issues. However, if I use
    <code>npx @11ty/eleventy --serve</code> and make changes to the post with
    the <code>templateEngineOverride</code>, it will create a folder named
    exactly <code>{&#37; shortDate date %}</code> at the root of the site and
    that will be used in collection item URLs resulting in a link that can't be
    visited and a "URI malformed (via URIError)"" error in the console.
  </p>

  <p>
    An odd <em>feature</em> of this problem is that, even with
    <code>npx @11ty/eleventy --serve</code>, it builds the page correctly the
    first time. It only breaks when changes are made to the page while it's
    running.
