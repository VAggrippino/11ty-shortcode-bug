<h1><code>templateEngineOverride</code> Breaks Permalink Shortcode</h1>
<p>2023/04</p>
<p>When a page uses <code>templateEngineOverride</code>, it forgets how to process shortcodes
used in the <code>permalink</code> Front Matter value, but only on the second and
subsequent builds of the page.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Page Demonstrating Bug](/{% shortDate page.date %}/{{ page.fileSlug }}/)</li>
<li><a href="/2023/04/unaffected-page/">Unaffected Page</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Oops! â†‘ The bug demonstrated in this repository also breaks the markdown in this
README file when I use the Liquid for loop. Here are some GFM relative links
instead:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="page-demonstrating-bug.md">Page Demonstrating Bug</a></li>
<li><a href="unaffected-page.md">Unaffected Page</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>My site is a blog and I use a shortcode which formats the post dates so that
they work as part of the URL.</p>
<p>I want to write a post discussing Liquid syntax and I don't want the Liquid code
used in the post to be processed by the template engine. I change the template
engine so that the Liquid code in the post isn't processed:</p>
<pre><code>  templateEngineOverride: md
</code></pre>
<p>In this situation, if I use the command <code>npx @11ty/eleventy</code>, there are no
issues. However, if I use <code>npx @11ty/eleventy --serve</code> and make changes to the
post with the <code>templateEngineOverride</code> while it's running, it will create a
folder named exactly <code>{% shortDate date %}</code> at the root of the site and that
will be used in
collection item URLs resulting in a link that can't be visited and a &quot;URI
malformed (via URIError)&quot;&quot; error in the console.</p>
<p>An odd <em>feature</em> of this problem is that, even with
<code>npx @11ty/eleventy --serve</code>, it builds the page correctly the first time. It
only breaks when changes are made to the page while it's running.</p>
